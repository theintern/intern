Intern is a complete test system for JavaScript designed to help you write and
run consistent, high-quality test cases for your JavaScript libraries and
applications. It can be used to test _any_ JavaScript code.

- Plain JavaScript code, in any module format (or no module format!)
- Web pages generated by server-side languages (like Java, PHP, or Ruby)
- Native or hybrid iOS, Android, and Firefox OS applications
- TypeScript code when running in Node, with no additional config

Intern is minimally prescriptive and enforces only a basic set of best practices
designed to ensure your tests stay maintainable over time. Its extensible
architecture allows you to write custom test interfaces, executors, and
reporters to influence how your tests run & easily integrate with your existing
coding environment. Intern also comes with Grunt tasks so it can be quickly
added to existing Grunt-based workflows, and is designed to work out-of-the-box
with popular continuous integration services like Jenkins and Travis CI.

If you’re into name-dropping, Intern gets used every day by teams at Twitter,
Stripe, Mozilla, IBM, Marriott, Philips, Zenput, Alfresco, Esri, HSBC, ING,
Intuit, and more. It’s also the testing framework of choice for
[growing numbers of open-source projects](https://github.com/search?p=2&q=tests+filename%3Aintern.js&ref=searchresults&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

> 💡 If you’re an Intern user who’s new to Intern 4, see the
    [Changes from Intern 3](docs/changes_from_3.md) document for a summary of the
    major differences. For Intern 3 documentation, please see
    [the Intern 3 README](https://github.com/theintern/intern/tree/3.4#intern).

## Quick start

1.  Install from npm

    ```sh
    $ cd /my/project
    $ npm install intern
    ```

2.  Create an `intern.json` file in your project root.

    ```js
    {
      "suites": "tests/unit/**/*.js"
    }
    ```

3.  Verify that your configuration works by running Intern and checking that no
    errors are output.

    ```sh
    $ ./node_modules/.bin/intern
    ```

4.  Start [writing tests](docs/writing_tests.md)!

## TypeScript setup

Intern installs a global variable that tests may not be aware of if nothing
imports the base `intern` package. To ensure Intern’s types are loaded, add the
following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["intern"]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, add a triple-slash directive to the top of your suite files:

```ts
/// <reference types="intern" />
```

## Compatibility

Intern can run unit tests in most browsers that support ECMAScript 5, including
mobile browsers on Android and iOS, and in Node 6+. Note that Internet Explorer
9 is not supported.

Intern’s self-tests run against IE 10 and 11, Firefox 36 and current, Chrome 38
and current, and Safari 9 and 10, as well as the latest LTS and current versions
of Node.

Intern can run functional tests using WebDriver-compatible applications and
services, including Selenium, Appium, Selendroid. It has built-in support for
cloud testing services from [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com),
[CrossBrowserTesting](https://crossbrowsertesting.com),
[SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com), and [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com).
