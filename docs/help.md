# Getting help

# Community support

The Intern community is available to assist you with basic questions, advice,
and general guidance. There are three primary ways to get community support:

- [Post a question to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=intern)
- [Join theintern/intern on Gitter](https://gitter.im/theintern/intern)
- [Join #intern on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=intern)

# Commercial support

Some problems are too complicated, specific, time-sensitive, or confidential to
be solved through free community support. In these cases, the creators of
Intern, [SitePen](https://sitepen.com), offer commercial support services for
you or your company. Commercial support has several advantages over community
support:

- Guaranteed response
- 24 hours maximum response time
- Priority bug fix and enhancement requests
- Total confidentiality for your next big idea
- Provides direct financial support for ongoing development of Intern

If you aren’t sure if commercial support is right for you, we’re happy to take a
few minutes to talk through your needs in greater detail.
