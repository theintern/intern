# Getting help

# Community support

The Intern community is available to assist you with basic questions, advice, and general guidance. There are three primary ways to get community support:

* [Post a question to Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=intern)
* [Join theintern/intern on Gitter](https://gitter.im/theintern/intern)
* [Join #intern on Freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=intern)

# Commercial support

Some problems are too complicated, specific, time-sensitive, or confidential to be solved through free community support. In these cases, the creators of Intern, [SitePen](https://sitepen.com), offer commercial support services for you or your company. Commercial support has several advantages over community support:

* Guaranteed response
* 24 hours maximum response time
* Priority bug fix and enhancement requests
* Total confidentiality for your next big idea
* Provides direct financial support for ongoing development of Intern

If you aren’t sure if commercial support is right for you, we’re happy to take a few minutes to talk through your needs in greater detail. [Get in touch](https://www.sitepen.com/site/contact.html) to schedule a time!
