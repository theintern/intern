## Jenkins

When integrating Intern with Jenkins, there are two primary ways to proceed:
either creating a new project that executes Intern as a post-build action for
your primary project using a shared workspace, or by creating a multi-step
free-style software project that executes Intern after the first (existing)
build step.

For projects that are already using Maven, a third option is to execute Intern
using [exec-maven-plugin](http://mojo.codehaus.org/exec-maven-plugin/) from an
existing `pom.xml`.

When using Intern with Jenkins, use the `junit` reporter and enable the “Publish
JUnit test result report” post-build action for the best test results display.

To add code coverage data to Jenkins, add the `cobertura` reporter, install the
Cobertura plugin for Jenkins, and enable the “Publish Cobertura Coverage Report”
post-build action.

### Intern as a post-build action to an existing project

This option enables you to use an existing build project by adding a new project
that executes unit tests in a separate job from the main build. This option is
ideal for situations where you want to be able to manage the build and testing
processes separately, or have several projects that need to be built downstream
from the main project that can occur in parallel with test execution.

In order to accomplish this efficiently without the need to copy artifacts, use
of the Shared Workspace plugin is recommended. To install and configure the
Shared Workspace plugin, follow these steps:

1.  Install the Shared Workspace plugin from the Jenkins → Manage Jenkins →
    Manage Plugins page.
2.  Go to the Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System page.
3.  Under Workspace Sharing, add a new shared workspace. For the purposes of
    these instructions, this shared workspace will be called “myApp”.
4.  Save changes.

Once the Shared Workspace plugin is installed, all projects that need to share
the same workspace must be updated. The shared workspace for each project can be
selected from the first section of the project’s configuration page.

Once the main project is set to use the shared workspace, the new unit test
project should be created:

1.  Create a new free-style software project, e.g. “myApp-tests”.
2.  At the top of the configuration, change the shared workspace to
    “myApp-tests”.
3.  Under “Source Code Management”, leave the “None” option checked. Because of
    the shared workspace, source code checkout will be handled by the upstream
    project.
4.  Under “Build triggers”, check the “Build after other projects are built”
    checkbox. Enter the name of the existing Maven project in the text box that
    appears. (This will create a corresponding post-build action to build
    “myApp-tests” in the existing project’s configuration.)
5.  Under “Build”, click the “Add build step” button and choose “Execute shell”
    from the drop-down.
6.  Under “Execute shell”, enter the command you want to use to run Intern. See
    [Running Intern](running.md) for possible commands.
7.  Save changes.

Once this project has been configured, test everything by running a build on the
main project. Once the main project build finishes successfully, the new
“myApp-tests” project will begin executing automatically.

### Intern as part of a free-style software project

When working with an existing free-style software project it is possible to
simply add the unit testing as an extra build step, following steps similar to
the above:

1.  Open the configuration page for the existing free-style software project.
2.  Under “Build”, click the “Add build step” button and choose “Execute shell”
    from the drop-down.
3.  Under “Execute shell”, enter the command you want to use to run Intern. See
    the Running tests section for possible commands.
4.  Save changes.

## Intern as an execution step in a Maven pom.xml

Intern can be executed by Maven from a `pom.xml` during the test or
integration-test phases of the build by using the exec-maven-plugin to spawn a
new Intern process:

```xml
<plugin>
    <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>run-tests</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>exec</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <executable>node_modules/.bin/intern</executable>
        <arguments>
            <argument>config=intern.json</argument>
        </arguments>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

The executable and arguments elements should be modified to run Intern using
your desired executor and configuration.

## Travis CI

In order to enable [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) builds for your project,
you must first create a `.travis.yml` in your repository root that will load and
execute Intern:

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - '8'
script: node_modules/.bin/intern
```

> 💡 If you are using a cloud hosting provider like
> [BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com), [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com),
> or [TestingBot](https://testingbot.com), you can add
> [environment variables](how_to.md#use-intern-with-a-remote-service-like-browserstack)
> holding your access credentials either through the Travis CI Web site by going
> to the repository’s settings page, or by adding an
> [env list](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/) to your
> `.travis.yml` configuration.

Once you have a Travis configuration, you just need to actually start the thing:

1.  Go to https://travis-ci.org/
2.  Click “Sign in with GitHub” at the top-right
3.  Allow Travis CI to access your GitHub account
4.  Go to https://travis-ci.org/profile
5.  Click “Sync now”, if necessary, to list all your GitHub projects
6.  Click the on/off switch next to the repository you want to test

The next time you push commits to the repository, you will be able to watch
Intern happily execute all your tests directly from the Travis CI Web site. Any
time you make a new commit, or a new pull request is issued, Travis will
automatically re-run your test suite and send notification emails on failure.

## TeamCity

There are two primary ways that Intern can be integrated with a
[TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) project: either by adding a new
build configuration that is chained using a post-build trigger, or by adding
additional build steps to an existing build configuration.

When using Intern with TeamCity, use Intern’s `teamcity` reporter for best
integration.

### Intern as an additional build step

1.  Go to the project that you want to add Intern to and click “Edit Project
    Settings” at the top-right.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click “General Settings”.
3.  Under “Build Configurations”, click “Edit” on the existing build
    configuration you want to add Intern to.
4.  In the left-hand menu, click “Build Steps”.
5.  Click “Add build step”.
6.  Select “Command Line” from the “Runner type” drop-down.
7.  Enter a name like “Run Intern” as the step name.
8.  Select “Custom Script” from the “Run” drop-down.
9.  Under “Custom script”, enter the command you want to use to run Intern. See
    the Running tests section for possible commands.
10. Click “Save”.

### Intern as a separate build configuration

1.  Go to the project that you want to add Intern to and click “Edit Project
    Settings” at the top-right.
2.  In the left-hand menu, click “General Settings”.
3.  Under “Build Configurations”, click “Create build configuration”.
4.  Enter a name like “Intern” as the build configuration name.
5.  Click “Save”.

7.  Click “Add build step”.
8.  Select “Command Line” from the “Runner type” drop-down.
9.  Enter a name like “Run Intern” as the step name.
10. Select “Custom Script” from the “Run” drop-down.
11. Under “Custom script”, enter the command you want to use to run Intern. See
    the Running tests section for possible commands.
12. Click “Save”.
13. Go back to the settings page for the project.
14. In the left-hand menu, click “General Settings”.
15. Click “Edit” on the build configuration you want to trigger Intern from.
16. In the left-hand menu, click “Triggers”.
17. Click “Add new trigger”.
18. Choose “Finish Build Trigger” from the drop-down.
19. Under “Build configuration”, choose the Intern build configuration that was
    just created.
20. Check “Trigger after successful build only”.
21. Click “Save”.

## Codeship

To use Intern with [Codeship](https://codeship.com), you’ll need to configure a
test pipeline:

### For a new project

1.  Log in to Codeship.
2.  In the upper-left corner, click “Select Project...”.
3.  Click the “Create a new project” button.
4.  Connect your GitHub or Bitbucket account as required.
5.  Choose the repository you’d like to test.
6.  Select “I want to create my own custom commands” from the drop down box
    labeled “Select your technology to pre-populate basic commands”.
7.  The following steps are the same as for an existing project.
8.  Once completed, click “Save and go to dashboard” and then push a commit to
    see your build tested.

### For an existing project

1.  Log in to Codeship.
2.  In the upper-left corner, click “Select Project...”.
3.  Select the gear icon to the right of your project’s name.
4.  From the “Test” Project Settings page, select “I want to create my own
    custom commands” from the drop down box labeled “Select your technology to
    pre-populate basic commands”.
5.  The remaining steps are identical to creating any new project with Codeship.

### Setup Commands

Setup Commands are those that allow you to set up your environment. For testing
a project with Intern, you must install node and your project’s dependencies:

```bash
# Install the version of node specified in your package.json
nvm install node

# Install project requirements
npm install
```

### Configure Test Pipelines

The test pipeline is what actually runs your specified test commands. This is
equivalent to running the tests on your local development environment. For
example, to run the Intern self-tests, you would enter the following command:

```bash
# run intern with the specified configuration
node_modules/.bin/intern config=intern.json
```

If you want to run tests with Selenium, Codeship supports this as well! You just
need to
[curl and run this script](https://github.com/codeship/scripts/blob/master/packages/selenium_server.sh)
before running Intern using the `"null"` tunnel.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codeship/scripts/master/packages/selenium_server.sh | bash -s
node_modules/.bin/intern tunnel=null
```

## Bamboo

Using Intern with [Bamboo](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo) involves
creating a build plan, described below. Note that the instructions below were
tested using Bamboo Cloud edition, but configuring a build plan task should work
similarly using a local agent.

### Manage elastic instances

By default, if you run a build on Bamboo and an agent isn’t available, an
Elastic Bamboo image is started as a Windows Server instance. Intern behavior is
more consistent running in a POSIX compliant environment, so follow the steps
below to create a Linux instance:

1.  From the gear icon menu in the upper-right corner of any Bamboo
    administration page, select “Elastic instances”.
2.  Click the “Start new elastic instances” button in the upper-right corner of
    the page.
3.  Under the “Elastic image configuration name” drop down, select “Ubuntu stock
    image”.
4.  Click the “Submit” button.

You will be taken to the “Manage elastic instances” page, where you will see
your image and its current state. Once the image status is “Running”, the
Elastic Agent starts. Once the agent has started and is either “Pending” or
“Idle”, you may begin your build.

### Create a build plan

1.  Click the “Create” drop down button at the top-middle of any Bamboo
    administration page.
2.  Select “Create a new plan” from the menu.
3.  Select or create a Project to house the build plan.
4.  Give the build plan a name and key, for your reference, and provide an
    optional description.
5.  Link the build plan to a previously linked or new repository.
6.  Click “Configure plan”.

### Configure your build plan

By default, the plan starts with an initial task of “Source Code Checkout”,
which you can leave configured as is, because you linked the repository in a
previous step.

1.  Add a task of “npm”.
2.  Use Node.js executable “Node.js 4” (or newer).
3.  Provide it with a Command of “install” and save the task.
4.  Add a task of “Script”.
5.  In the script body, write the following (use the version of node chosen in
    step 2):
    ```
    /opt/node-0.12/bin/node ${bamboo.build.working.directory}/node_modules/.bin/intern \
      reporters=junit \
      > results.xml
    ```
6.  Save the Script task.
7.  Add a task of “JUnit Parser”.
8.  Enter “\*” in the “Specify custom results directories” field and save the
    task.
9.  Below the task configuration interface, make sure “Yes please!” is checked
    under the “Enable this plan?” heading.
10. Click the “Create” button to create your build plan.

### Running your build plan and verifying its output

1.  Click the “Build” drop down menu item from the Bamboo administration page
    top menu and select “All build plans”.
2.  Select your plan from those shown.
3.  Click “Run” and then “Run plan” in the upper-right corner of the page.
4.  Once your plan has finished running, you will see a “Tests” tab on the page,
    which you can click through and see details of every test.
