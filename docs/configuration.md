<!-- vim-markdown-toc -->

Intern is configured with a standard JavaScript object. This object may contain
properties applicable to either environment that Intern can run in (Node or
browser). Config properties may be set via a file, the command line, browser
query args, or an environment variable. All of these methods use the same basic
syntax and provide the same capabilities. Assuming Intern is being run with the
default [Node runner](running.md#node) or [browser runner](running.md#browser)
and without a `config` argument, Intern will attempt to load configuration
informatioon from an `intern.json` file in the project root.

Wherever config property values come from, the executor will validate and
normalize them into a canonical format ("resolve" them) when the testing process
starts. This allows the executor’s constructor or `configure` method to be
flexible in what data it accepts. For example, the canonical form of the
`environments` property is an array of objects:

```ts
environments: [{ browserName: 'chrome' }];
```

However, Intern will accept a simple string for the `environments` property and
will expand it into an array of a single object where the `browserName` property
is the given string.

## Schema

Intern includes a
[JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html) for
its config format. This schema describes all the properties that might be
included in an `intern.json` config file, and includes help text for each
property.

To use the schema with an editor such as VS Code, add a `$schema` property to
your `intern.json` file that points to the schema, like:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/intern/schemas/config.json"
}
```

## Environment-specific config

Tests can run in two basic environments: Node and browsers. By default,
“resource” properties (`suites`, `plugins`, `reporters`, and `loader`) in a
config file apply to both environments. This means that if the same config is
used to run tests in a browser and in Node, the same resources will be loaded in
both environments. In some cases this isn’t desirable because tests may load
application code that depends on environment-specific properties or features,
such as the DOM. Intern’s config provides `node` and `browser` properties for
this use case. These properties specify resources that will only be loaded in
the given environment. The values in these properties will be
[shallowly mixed into the base config](#configuration-resolution) rather than
replacing it.

> ⚠️ Note that this is different than the `mode` property in Intern 3, which had
> values of “client” or “runner”. Intern 3’s mode indicated whether tests were
> being run in unit test or functional test mode, but it was sometimes used as
> an environment check due to the fact that functional tests always run in Node.

## Properties

A number of config properties are applicable whether Intern is running in Node
or directly in a browser. Some of the more common ones are listed below.

| [serverUrl]          | A URL a remote executor can use to reach the local Intern                                                                                                        | `http://localhost:9000`     |

The environment-specific properties come into play when Intern is running in
that environment:

| Property | Description                                                                            | Default |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| browser  | Resources (loader, plugins, reporters, suites) that only apply to browser tests        | `{}`    |
| node     | Resources (loader, plugins, reporters, suites, tsconfig) that only apply to Node tests | `{}`    |

There are also several properties that are handled by the config file processing
system that aren’t directly involved in the testing process. These properties
are ignored if set programmatically.

| Property    | Description                                                        |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| description | A short string describing a test config                            |
| [extends]   | Another config or config file that the config extends              |
| help        | Display a help message                                             |
| showConfig  | When true, show the resolved configuration and exit                |
| showConfigs | When true, show information about the currently loaded config file |

### Suite glob expressions

Suites may be specified as file paths or using glob expressions. Globbing is
handled with the [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) Node package.

```json5
{
  suites: ['tests/unit/**/*.js', 'tests/integration/foo.js']
}
```

Intern also understands glob-based exclusion using the `!` modifier:

```json5
{
  suites: ['tests/**/*.js', '!tests/functional/**']
}
```

Note that using globs with the browser client _requires_ that Intern’s own
server be used to serve test suites. This is because the browser client on its
own has no way to resolve file system globs; it passes the to the Intern server
running on Node, which resolves them and returns list of file paths.

### extends

If the `extends` property is set in a base config, it must be the path to a
different config file. At run time, the properties from the config file with the
`extends` value will be mixed into the properties from the config file being
extended.

If the `extends` property is set in a child config, it must be the name of a
different child config within the same config file, or an array of such names.
When a child config extends multiple other child configs, properties from the
right-most config being extended will override properties from configs to the
left.

```json5
{
  configs: {
    a: {
      /* ... */
    },
    b: {
      /* ... */
    },
    c: {
      /* ... */
    },
    d: {
      extends: ['a', 'c']
      /* ... */
    }
  }
}
```

Given the config above, and assuming child config “d” is selected, the following
resolution process will occur:

1.  Child “c” will be mixed into child “a”
2.  Child “d” will be mixed into the result of 1
3.  The result of 2 will be mixed into the base config
4.  The result of 3 will be the resolved config

## Displaying config information

Intern has two config properties that can be used to display configuration
information: `showConfig` and `showConfigs`.

### showConfig

Setting the `showConfig` property to `true` will cause Intern to dump the
resolved configuration to the current environment’s console.

```
$ npx intern showConfig
{
    "bail": false,
    "baseline": false,
    "benchmark": false,
    "reporters": [
        {
            "name": "console"
        }
    ]
}
```

### showConfigs

Setting the `showConfigs` property to `true` will cause Intern to show
information about a given config file. Intern will print the value of the
current config file’s `description` property, and then list all child configs
contained in the config file. For example, with a config file containing the
following data:

```json5
{
  description: 'Default test suite',
  configs: {
    webdriver: {
      description: 'Run webdriver tests'
    },
    ci: {
      description: 'Run tests on a CI server'
    }
  }
}
```

running Intern with the `showConfigs` property set would display the following
text:

```
$ npx intern showConfigs
Default test suite

Configs:
  webdriver  (Run webdriver tests)
  ci         (Run tests on a CI server)
```

## Config structure

The config structure is a simple JSON object, so all of its property values must
be serializable (RegExp objects are serialized to strings).

```json5
{
  // General properties
  bail: false,
  baseline: false,
  suites: ['tests/unit/*.js'],

  // Browser and node specific resources
  browser: {
    suites: ['tests/unit/dom_stuff.js']
  },
  node: {
    suites: ['tests/unit/dom_stuff.js']
  },

  configs: {
    // Child configs have the same structure as the main config
    ci: {
      bail: true,
      'suites+': ['tests/unit/other.js']
    }
  }
}
```

There are four general sections to a config:

- **General properties**: this includes everything but "browser", "configs", and
  "node"
- **Node-specific resources**: resource properties ("loader", "plugins",
  "reporters", "suites") that apply only to Node environments.
- **Browser-specific resources**: resource properties ("loader", "plugins",
  "reporters", "suites") that apply only to browser environments.
- **Child configs**: named configs in the "configs" object; each of these can
  have any config properties except "configs" (i.e., general properties, Node
  resources, and browser resources).

## Sources of configuration information

Intern takes in configuration data from several sources. In order of increasing
precedence, they are:

1.  [Config file](#config-file)
2.  [Environment variable](#environment-variable)
3.  [Command line or query args](#command-line-or-query-args)
4.  [Programmatically](#programmatically)

Multiple configuration methods may be used during a single run of Intern. The
configuration will be fully resolved before tests are executed.

### Config File

An Intern config file is a JSON file specifying config properties, for example:

```json5
{
  environments: [{ browserName: 'chrome' }],
  suites: ['tests/unit/all.js']
}
```

By default, intern will try to load a file named `intern.json` from the project
root directory. A different config file can be specified by passing a `config`
property to the Node or browser runners.

A child config can be selected by adding `@<child>` to the config file name. For
example, to load a child config named “ci” from the default config file, you
could run:

```sh
$ npx intern config=@ci
```

To load a config named “remote” from a config file named “intern-local.json”,
run:

```sh
$ npx intern config=intern-local.json@remote
```

### Environment variable

In a Node environment, Intern may be configured using an `INTERN_ARGS`
environment variable. This variable is treated just like a string of command
line arguments. For example, these two executions of Intern are equivalent:

```sh
$ npx intern grep='run.*' suites=
```

```sh
export INTERN_ARGS="grep=run.* suites="
$ npx intern
```

### Command line

Config properties may be provided directly on the command line when starting
Intern. Properties must be specified using `property=value` syntax. For example,

```sh
$ npx intern grep='run.*' suites=
```

Object values may be input as serialized strings (e.g.,
`environments='{"browserName":"chrome"}'`). Array values may be set by repeating
a property (e.g., `suites="foo.js" suites="bar.js"`).

### Query args

Query args work very similarly to command line args. They have the same format,
but with URL query arg separators, and escaping of special characters as
necessary.

```
http://localhost:8080/node_modules/intern/?grep=run.*&suites=
```

### Programmatically

When creating an executor programmatically it may be configured via its
constructor, and/or via its `configure` method.

```ts
const intern = new Node({ grep: /run.*/, suites: [] });
```

_or_

```ts
intern.configure({ grep: /run.*/, suites: [] });
```

The `configure` method may be called any number of times before the testing
process is started.

## Configuring loaders

Intern uses loader scripts to communicate with various loaders so test suites of
any module format may be used. Loader scripts are simply standalone scripts
(like plugins) that connect Intern with a loader. Intern has a number of [loader
scripts] available to help it work with popular loaders and formats. If no
loader script is defined, then Intern will use the default loader script for the
environment (CommonJS in Node and &lt;script> tag injection in the browser).

To use one of Intern's pre-defined loader scripts, simply specify it's name. The
loader script will expect the loader package to be installed in `node_modules`
using NPM.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    loader: 'dojo'
  }
}
```

Additional options may be provided through the options parameter. These options
are passed through to the registered loader script.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    loader: {
      script: './support/my/custom/loader.js',
      options: { basePath: '_build' }
    }
  }
}
```

It's useful to think of Intern's loader scriptss as glue code that Intern uses
to load configured suites within the environment. When Intern needs to load a
module (i.e. a test suite) it hands off a list of these modules to the loader
script and waits for the loading process to be handled by the loader. For more
information and options look at the [loader scripts] in the Intern repository.

## Configuring plugins

Plugins are standalone scripts or modules that are loaded by Intern. Standalone
plugins (ones that do not require a loader) are ran in-order early in the Intern
lifecycle before practically anything else. This is to allow plugins a chance to
listen to Intern events and augment the environment as early as possible. Module
plugins have a `useLoader` property and are loaded later in Intern's lifecycle
with the configured loader. Any number of plugins may be added to Intern.

```json5
{
  plugins: [
    'node_modules/babel-register/lib/node.js',
    {
      script: 'tests/support/mongodbAccess.js',
      options: { dbUrl: 'https://testdb.local' }
    },
    {
      script: 'tests/support/dojoMocking.js',
      useLoader: true
    }
  ]
}
```

Similar to loader scripts, plugin configurations with `options` are passed to
the plugin when it is registered with Intern.

## Configuration resolution

At runtime, the environment-specific resources and any
[active child configs](#config-file) will be mixed into the resolved config. In
general, properties from more specific sources will override properties from
lower precedence sources. The order of precedence, from lowest to highest, is:

1.  A config being extended by the current config
2.  The current config
3.  An active child config in the current config

There are a few exceptions:

1.  **The "node" and "browser" properties in a child config are shallowly mixed
    into "node" and "browser" in the base config.** For example, if "node" in
    the base config looks like:
    ```json5
    "node": {
        "suites": [ "tests/unit/foo.js" ],
        "plugins": [ "tests/plugins/bar.js" ]
    }
    ```
    and "node" in a child config looks like:
    ```json5
    "node": {
        "suites": [ "tests/unit/baz.js" ],
    }
    ```
    then the value of node in the resolved config (assuming the child config is
    active) will be:
    ```json5
    "node": {
        // node.suites from the child overrides node.suites from the base config
        "suites": [ "tests/unit/baz.js" ],
        // node.plugins from the base config remains
        "plugins": [ "tests/plugins/bar.js" ]
    }
    ```
2.  **Resource arrays in "node" or "browser" ("plugins", "reporters", "suites"),
    are added to the corresponding resource arrays in the base config.** For
    example, if the base config has:
    ```json5
    "suites": [ "tests/unit/foo.js" ]
    ```
    and the "node" section has:
    ```json5
    "suites": [ "tests/unit/bar.js" ]
    ```
    both sets of suites will be loaded when running on Node.
3.  **Some properties can be extended (rather than replaced) by adding a '+' to
    the property name.** For example, if the base config has:
    ```json5
    "suites": [ "tests/unit/foo.js" ]
    ```
    and a child config has:
    ```json5
    "suites+": [ "tests/unit/bar.js" ]
    ```
    the resolved value of suites will be:
    ```json5
    "suites": [ "tests/unit/foo.js", "tests/unit/bar.js" ]
    ```
    Extendable properties are resources (**suites**, **plugins**,
    **reporters**), **instrumenterOptions**, **tunnelOptions**, and
    **capabilities**.
