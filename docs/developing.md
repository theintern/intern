# Developing

Intern is written in TypeScript. The various build lifecycle steps (build, test,
etc.) are handled through `npm`, and are implemented by scripts in the
[@theintern/dev](https://github.com/theintern/dev) package.

## Code style

The source is formatted using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
1.9+ during a pre-commit hook, so style should be mostly taken care of.

> üí°Prettier doesn't (yet) reflow comments; those should be wrapped at 80
> characters. Long lines for URLs are fine.

## Building Intern

Before you can do much else, you'll need to install Intern‚Äôs development
dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```

To build Intern, just run:

```
$ npm run build
```

## Running Self-Tests

To run the existing unit tests in Node, use:

```
$ npm test
```

To run unit tests in Node and a local instance of Chrome, use:

```
$ npm test config=@wd
```

Intern‚Äôs self tests work by using two different builds of the current version of
Intern, one in `_tests` and one in `_build`. Both instances are generated when
building Intern. The version in `_tests` is then used to run tests against the
version in `_build`.

## Writing Self-Tests

Tests are in the `tests` directory, and the test config is the `intern.json`
file in the project root. Tests are organized by type in `unit`, `functional`,
and `benchmark` directories. The directory structure within each type should
mirror the main src directory structure. For example, unit tests for
`src/lib/executors/Executor` should go in `tests/unit/lib/executors/Executor`.

There are a couple of techniques that can make writing unit tests faster.

- Intern includes a `watch` script that will rebuild source and test files when
  they're updated.
- Disable coverage with a `coverage=` command line option.
- Only run the suite that‚Äôs being edited.

Say you‚Äôre working on tests in `tests/unit/lib/Environment.ts`. Start the
watcher with `npm run watch`. Whenever you write a new test in Environment.ts,
run the updated suite with

```
npm test suites=_tests/tests/unit/lib/Environment.js coverage=
```

### TypeScript

As with the main Intern source, self-tests are written in TypeScript. The tests
have their own `tsconfig.json` file that inherits from the main Intern tsconfig.
The key difference is that the test tsconfig file defines a path mapping for the
non-relative ‚Äúsrc‚Äù path. This saves a bit of typing during test writing, but the
main advantage is that this path can be re-mapped at runtime to point to files
in the `_build/src` directory.

### Dojo 2 loader

Self tests in the browser use the [Dojo loader](https://github.com/dojo/loader)
so that individual modules can be loaded in the browser, and to allow module
dependencies to be mocked. The self-tests use the built-in `dojo2` loader
script.
